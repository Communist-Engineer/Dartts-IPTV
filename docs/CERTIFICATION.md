## 2. Channel Images

Create high-quality images (PNG format):

### Focus Icons (highlighted in UI)
- **icon_focus_hd.png** - 290Ã—218 pixels
- **icon_focus_fhd.png** - 336Ã—210 pixels

### Side Icons (unhighlighted in UI)

- **icon_side_fhd.png** - 180Ã—108 pixels

### Splash Screens (loading screen)
- **splash_hd.png** - 1280Ã—720 pixels
- **splash_fhd.png** - 1920Ã—1080 pixels

**Guidelines:**
- Use transparent backgrounds for icons
- Include app branding/logo
- Avoid text smaller than 18pt
- Follow [Roku Design Guidelines](https://developer.roku.com/design/design-guidelines.md)

Place images in `source/images/` directory.

## 3. Deep Linking

Roku requires deep linking support for certification.

- [ ] Implement `contentId` handling in `main.brs`
- [ ] Support `mediaType` parameter
- [ ] Provide sample content in `deep_link_catalog.json`
- [ ] Test with Roku's Deep Linking Tester

### Test Deep Linking

```bash
curl -d '' "http://ROKU_IP:8060/launch/dev?contentId=sample_test1&mediaType=live"
```

Verify:
- App launches successfully
- Navigates directly to specified content
- Plays immediately (if applicable)
- Returns to home on back button

See [DEEP_LINKING.md](DEEP_LINKING.md) for details.

---

## 4. Content Requirements

- [ ] **NO copyrighted content** included in the package
- [ ] **NO pirated streams** in sample playlists
- [ ] **Legal notice** displayed on first run
- [ ] **User-supplied content only** - app does not provide streams

**Acceptable sample content:**
- Public domain test streams
- Your own licensed content
- Links to legal, publicly available streams
- Demo/test HLS feeds (Big Buck Bunny, Tears of Steel, etc.)

---

## 5. Functionality Testing

Test on multiple Roku devices (HD and 4K):

### Core Features
- [ ] App launches without crashes
- [ ] UI is responsive and navigable
- [ ] Text is readable on HD (720p) screens
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Back button works correctly
- [ ] Home button exits gracefully

### IPTV Features
- [ ] Add playlist from URL
- [ ] Parse M3U with 100+ channels
- [ ] Browse channels by groups
- [ ] Play HLS streams
- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Display EPG data (if XMLTV provided)
- [ ] Captions toggle (if stream has CC)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty playlist URL
- [ ] Malformed M3U file
- [ ] Unreachable stream URL
- [ ] Network timeout
- [ ] Invalid XMLTV data
- [ ] Rapid navigation and button presses

---

## 6. Performance Requirements

- [ ] **Launch time** - App shows content within 5 seconds
- [ ] **Memory usage** - No leaks or excessive consumption
- [ ] **Network** - Handles slow connections gracefully
- [ ] **Buffering** - Shows loading indicators
- [ ] **Parsing** - Large playlists (1000+ channels) load within reasonable time

Monitor via telnet console:

```bash
telnet ROKU_IP 8085
```

---

## 7. Accessibility

- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Text size is readable (min 18pt on HD)
- [ ] High contrast between text and background

Dartt's IPTV 1.0 targets **English only** - add localization in future versions.
