## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- All HTTP requests use Roku's built-in `roUrlTransfer` with certificate verification
- HTTPS is recommended for all playlist and EPG URLs
- User-supplied URLs are validated to prevent injection attacks

### Data Privacy
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- Settings and favorites are stored locally on the Roku device only
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking

### Content Safety
- The app displays a legal notice on first run
- Users must acknowledge responsibility for their streams
- No built-in pirate feeds or copyrighted content

### Input Validation
- M3U and XMLTV parsers handle malformed input gracefully
- URL validation prevents non-HTTP(S) schemes by default
- File paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal

## Known Limitations

- **DRM**: Dartt's IPTV does not support DRM-protected streams (by design)
- **External Sources**: The app cannot control or validate third-party stream legality
- **Roku Constraints**: Limited by Roku OS security and SceneGraph capabilities
